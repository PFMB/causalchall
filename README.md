# Analysis of the 2022 ACIC Data Challenge

- analysis_challenge. r is the main file to run the analyses
- it uses both own_learners.r (for super learning setup) and ltmleMSM_CI.R (for CI estimation)
- ATT_single_time_paper.R is the simulation from Appendix 4.5 of the paper
- XXX.R produces Figure 1 of the paper
- run1_results1_1700.csv, run1_results1701_3400.csv and run1_learner_weights.txt are the results of the analyses (the former two files were combined and submitted to the data challenge). 
- The folders Results and logResults contain more results, for both the analysis without and with log-transformation of the confounders
